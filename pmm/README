Usage
-----

Just run `make` to compile. You may need to rewrite Makefile and/or source
files according to your environment.

You will find two binary files in bin/ directory:

- `bin/estimate`: maximum-likelihood estimation program.
- `bin/csv2dump`: converting CSV input to a dump file that `estimate` reads.

Input data must be a CSV in "key,value" format for each line.
"key" must be a string and used to identify the Segment.
"value" must be an integer. This is an observed value in the Segment.

`bin/estimate` reads a CSV from stdin by default and writes the model file
to stdout. Progress information is written to stderr.

//redirect stdin to csv_file, stdout to estimate.out, stderr to estimate.err
Example:
	
    $ ./bin/estimate < your_csv_file > estimate.out 2> estimate.err

CSV reading is time-consuming process. You can use "dump file" to make it
faster.

//Line 1: redirect stdin to csv_file
//Line 2: redirect stdout to estimate.out while redirect stderr to estimate.err
Example:

    $ ./bin/csv2dump 1 path_to_dump_file < your_csv_file
    $ ./bin/estimate -b path_to_dump_file > estimate.out 2> estimate.err

Run each command with "-h" option to show all program options.
